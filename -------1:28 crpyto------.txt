-------1/28 crpyto------

crypto is not the solution. it' spart of the system. It's not easy. not cheap
modern, aplied cryto

<Confidentiality>

1. Threat: 
Listen /oberse the network 
observe the endpoint
someone could temper the message
 	The aversay is the networl. (-Doleve-Yao adversary)
 		-read all messages
 		-change any message
 		-delete any message

2. Harm:
contents of message could be disclosed

3. Vulnerbility:
network under control of adversary

4. Countermeasure
Encryption

********************************************************************

Shared-key Encryption

O. k = Gen(len)
1. Alice: C = Encrypt ( m  ; k)         where m is i.e.plaintext, and C is Ciphertext 
2. Alice --> send to Bob : C
3. Bob : m = Decrpt(c ; k)  			where ...


(Gen, Enc, Dec) encription scheme --> Ctyptosystem


Kerchhoff's principle: 

1. Secrecy of the message should depend only on the key being secret.
   espescially not depend on the encrption scheme itself veing secret.

2. For each key, Enc behaves like a random function
	--> the map from the plainttext m to ciphertext c should be random
		randomness? real or look like real. ex:
												One-time pad(OTP) 
												 - len key =  
												 - one key / message
												 - exchange keys securely

												 Enc(m;k) m xor K
Block cipher

 	Enc(m, k) m is fixed length. Ex: 
 									- DES (block size = 64 bits, key size is 56 bits)
 									- 3 DES (bloack size = 64 bits, key size: 112 bits or 168 bits) since hardware gets better
 									- AES (block size = 128 bits, key size 128, 192, 256 bits)

 			break a crypto system?
 								brute force -  try every key 2^256 for AES 256 bits key sisze

 								break attark that succeeds in fewer steps than brute force ^99.5(secruity level this is what you care about as people being smart)
