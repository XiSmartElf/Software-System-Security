<h1>Homework 1:  Part II</h1>

<p>Due: <span class="duedate">Wednesday, February 11, 11:59 pm</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Few false ideas have more firmly gripped the minds of so many 
intelligent men than the one that, if they just tried, they could 
invent a cipher that no one could break.</i> 
&mdash;David Kahn</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>0. Hybrid Decryption</h3>

<p>If you're reading this plaintext, 
you've already solved Part I of this homework.</p>

<p><span class="phead">What to submit:</span> a directory 
named <tt>hybrid</tt> containing the source code for
your program that decrypted Part II.</p>

<p><i>Evaluation:</i> We will grade
your program using different files (keys, ciphertexts, etc.) than just
those supplied in <tt>hw1.II.zip</tt>.  If your program fails to correctly decrypt 
the new ciphertexts we give it, you will receive partial-to-no credit.
If your program fails to compile, you will receive no credit.  </p>

<h3>1. Authenticated Encryption</h3>

<p>
CBC-MAC is a message authentication code based on cipher-block chaining.
With CBC-MAC, the tag t for a message m under key k is the last ciphertext block produced by encryption of
m with k in CBC mode.  That is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
CBC-MAC(m; k) = c_n
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where c_n = Enc(c_{n-1} xor m_n; k), and n is the number of blocks in the message.  
Enc could be AES or some other block cipher; it doesn't matter for this problem.
Assume that Enc is deterministic.
Throughout this problem, assume that the message length is a multiple of
the block length and that no padding scheme is used.   (Indeed, none is necessary
under the assumption.)</p>

<p>A CS 5430 student proposes the following method, which we'll call
AECBC, for authenticated encryption:</p>

<blockquote><p>AECBC:  Assume that Alice and Bob already share a key
k. Alice computes the CBC-MAC tag t of message m under key
k with initialization vector iv.  She then appends t to m, forming a new plaintext m'. She
encrypts m' in CBC mode with the same k and iv, forming ciphertext c.  Alice sends c to
Bob.  Bob can then decrypt and authenticate the message.</p></blockquote>

<p>AECBC is an instance of Mac-then-Encrypt.  Normally,
Mac-then-Encrypt would require processing all n plaintext
blocks twice, once for each key&mdash;that is, once for the
MAC operation, and once again for the encryption operation. 
But AECBC attempts an optimization:  instead
of using separate keys for encryption and authentication, it
uses only a single key.</p>

<ol>
<li>With the protocol narration 
notation used in the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS5430/2015sp/notes/crypto.php">course notes
on applied cryptography</a>,
write a full protocol specification for AECBC, 
including decryption and authentication.
Specifications that instead use different notation
(e.g., from one textbook or another) will not receive full credit.</li>
<li>Propose an implementation of AECBC that minimizes the number of
calls that need to be made to encryption function Enc.  What is the minimum number?
Justify your answer.  <i>Hint: fewer than 2n.</i></li>
<li>Unfortunately, AECBC does not provide integrity.  That
is, Bob will not be able to detect changes made to the message
by a Dolev-Yao attacker.  Show that this is true by clearly
and precisely describing an attack on AECBC.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>The moral of the story is:  don't invent your own cryptographic
protocols, and don't use one key for two (or more) purposes.</i></p>

<p><span class="phead">What to submit:</span> a directory 
named <tt>aecbc</tt> containing a text or PDF file, named <tt>aecbc.txt</tt>
or <tt>aecbc.pdf</tt>, with your answers to the above questions.</p>

<p><i>Evaluation:</i> We will grade
your answer based on its correctness and clarity.</p>

<h3>2. Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>Generate an RSA key pair.  Name the public key file
<tt><i>netid</i>_rsa_ver.bin</tt> and the private key file <tt><i>netid</i>_rsa_sign.bin</tt>,
where <i>netid</i> is your Cornell NetID.
The public key file should contain the raw bytes of an X.509 
encoding of the key. The private key should contain the raw bytes of a 
PKCS8 encoding of the key. Build a program that signs and verifies signatures.
Sign your submission file <tt><i>netid</i>_hw1.zip</tt> (described at the end of this
page) with the signing key.  Save the raw bytes of that signature in
a file named <tt><i>netid</i>_hw1.zip.sig</tt>.</p>

<p><span class="phead">What to submit:</span> a directory 
named <tt>sign</tt> containing your Java implementation.
Your directory should also contain a text or PDF file named <tt>keylength.txt</tt>
or <tt>keylength.pdf</tt>.  This file should justify
your choice of key length.</p>

<p><i>Evaluation:</i> We will grade your answer by running
our own signature verification program to ascertain whether
the signature you provide is valid w.r.t. the files you provide.
If your signature is not valid, we will look at your signing
program and might give you partial credit based on it.</p>

<h3>3. DES Crack</h3>

<p>The following file was encrypted with DES in CBC mode with
PKCS#5 padding:  
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS5430/2015sp/hw/1/hw1des.bin">
<tt>hw1des.bin</tt></a>.
The file contains the raw bytes output from the DES encryption.</p>

<p>You have learned the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plaintext is English.</li>
<!--<li>The encryption key was chosen in a particularly poor way: it's based
on an English word.  In particular, someone chose a word W from this
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS5430/2015sp/hw/1/words.txt">
word list</a>, then converted W to a key as follows:
<ul>
<li>Replace each character in W with a 0 followed by its 7-bit ASCII representation,
yielding 8 bits total for each character.
If W had C characters, this yields an 8C-bit sequence S.</li>
<li>If S has more than 64 bits, truncate S to make it 64 bits long.</li>
<li>If S has fewer than 64 bits, pad S at the end with 0's to make it 64 bits long.</li>
<li>Use the resulting sequence as the key.</li>
</ul>
</li>-->
<li> The first 36 bits of the encryption key are in the file 
    <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS5430/2015sp/hw/1/partialkey.txt">
    <tt>partialkey.txt</tt></a>.
    You don't know what the last 28 bits are.</li>
<li>The initialization vector used for CBC mode is all zeroes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your task is to recover the plaintext. You may use any combination
of programming languages, analysis techniques, third-party tools, 
etc. that you like.  We make no restrictions.</p>

<p><i>Warning:</i> We estimate that, using Java, the computation for this could take 
longer than 24 hours.  You should get
started early on this problem!</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> The <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/enc.html">
OpenSSL implementation of DES</a> is much faster
than Java's implementation.</p>

<p><span class="phead">What to submit:</span> a directory 
named <tt>crack</tt> containing the code you wrote.
Your directory should also include a file named <tt>plaintext.txt</tt>
containing the plaintext, and <tt>solution.txt</tt> or <tt>solution.pdf</tt>
explaining how your solution works.</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>Submit</p>
<ul><li>a file named <tt>hw1.zip</tt> containing all the folders
described above,</li>
<li>a file named <tt>sig.bin</tt> containing the raw bytes
of your signature on <tt>hw1.zip</tt>,</li>
<li>and a file named <tt>rsa_ver.bin</tt>
containing the raw bytes of an X.509 encoding of your signature 
verification key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit those three files to the Homework 1 assignment on CMS.</p>

<p>Submissions that do not adhere to the naming requirements stipulated here
will lose points.</p>
