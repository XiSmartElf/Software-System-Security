1. Enc +MAC  ke km Enc(m;ke),MAC(m;km)     SSH (not encouraged to use)
2. Enc then MAC.   C=Enc(m;ke) t=MAC(c;km)   send c,t   prrarbly most secure    IPsec
3. MAC then Enc.   t=MAC(m;km)  c=Enc(m,t;ke)  send c    SSL    padding oracle attack    (Way to go)

GCM Galos/ counter Mode

***********************************

SSL=TLS secure socket layer: 1996
  Sessions 
Client <----> Server

record: msg protected by MAC then ENC

certificates: binding bwt and identity and a key

				ids:indentity of the subject
				ks: subjecy's public key
				kI: issuer's private key

digital certificate:  I<<S>> sign(ids, ks; kI)


****************************  Principles of Security   *******************

Accountablity: Hold principals repinsible for their actions

1. Authorization: Mechanisim that governs whether actions are permited
2. Autentication: mechanisims that binds principals to actions
3. Audit: mechanisms that records that actions and principals that take them

1.Defense in Depth: 
Prefer complemntary mechanism over single one, Independent/ overlapping

2.Non-securecy of design:
secuity should not depend on secrecy of deisgn or mechanism

3.Economy of Mechanism:
prefer mechinisim that are simple and small.
TCB: trusted computing base. 
Keep the TCB small

4.Failsafe Dafaults:
Presenese of previllage
rather than absense of probibition
Should be the basis for allowing actions

5.Least Privilege (keep privillage small):
a Principle should have mimum previllage it need to accomplish its desired operations

6. Complete Mediation:
requested by princopal must be intercepted and determined to be accpetable according to policy
<Reference Monitor> imply comp Med

7. Separation of privilege:
--> Different's operations should require different privilleges
--> single operations might ometimes require multiple privilleges.
